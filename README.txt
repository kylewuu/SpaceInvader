Programming Assignment #1
Summer 2019

Every step has been completed.

Everything in the program is original and I came up with everything by myself except for the following:
[
--Having different colors were taken from the lecture notes

--Learning how to use the shaders and rendering was based off of CMPT 361 ProgrammingTutorial1

--Making the popup window was only done with the help of google
]
Apart from those listed above, everything is done by me and is 100% original.


Some addition features and notes that have been added are:
[
--When the player loses, the red enemies can still be seen in the background moving left and right, but not shooting nor moving down. Makes cool animation in the background.

--The neccesary controls have implemented, along with new controls that make the gameplay more intuitive.

--A better looking pop-up window doesn't take over the screen but just pops up in the middle while darkening the background. This was done with some googling online to get the css just right.

--Even though the game is already very balanced, it is very easy to go into the game.js file and edit any of the variables. All of the values are not hard coded in and every variable can be found at the top, intuitively named and very versitile.

--CAPSLOCK TO PAUSE: the game pauses, and you stop getting shot at and you cannot shoot nor move

--If you win, the border around the game blinks green, if you lose, the border blinks red

--When the game is being played, the border is blue

--The game can be found at https://github.com/kylewuu/SpaceInvader 

--The description div and the canvas spaces itself out when the screenheight is large enough

Extra Notes:

The css has been put onto the HTML file because the instructions only asked for one HTML along with a JS file and not a css file. All of the Javascript has been combined into one js file due to the same reason.
